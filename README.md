## A slightly *Lynchian* implementation of a blockchain in C

### There's something *decentralized* happening in the sleepy town of Twin Peaks...

This is a work in progress. I'm currently working on mirroring the Bitcoin protocol, but with a twist...

## Why?

## Installation

## Tests

## Credits

On Linux, run the following command from the source directory:
```
  # sh tests/linux/runtests.sh
```

This project utilizes code from:
 * Brad Conte's implementation of SHA-256, which can be found at https://github.com/B-Con/crypto-algorithms
 * A "toy" implementation of ECDSA from https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm

## Built with

 * Pop!\_OS 20.10
 * Vim 8.2
 * Valgrind 3.18.0
 * gcc 10.2.0
