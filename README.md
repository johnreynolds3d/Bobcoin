## A slightly *Lynchian* Implementation of a Blockchain in C

There's something *decentralized* happening in the sleepy town of Twin Peaks...

This is a work in progress. I'm currently working on mirroring the Bitcoin protocol, but with a twist...

I'm using Brad Conte's implementation of SHA-256, which can be found at https://github.com/B-Con/crypto-algorithms,
and the "toy" version of ECDSA from https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm
