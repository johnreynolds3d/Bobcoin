## An Implementation of a Blockchain in C

There's something *decentralized* happening in the sleepy town of Twin Peaks...

This is a work in progress. I'm currently working on modifying it to use the Bitcoin model. 

I'm using Brad Conte's implementation of SHA-256, which can be found at https://github.com/B-Con/crypto-algorithms
